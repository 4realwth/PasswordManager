Password Manager (My first project in Python) 

**Description:**
This Password Manager is a Python-based application designed to securely store and manage your passwords. 
It uses advanced encryption to ensure that all stored passwords are kept safe.

**Features:**
Generate strong, random passwords.
Encrypt and store passwords securely.
Retrieve stored passwords.
Delete stored passwords.
Command-line interface for easy use.

**Installation:**
Prerequisites
1. Python 3.x
2. Pip (Python package installer)

**Setup:**
Clone the Repository
git clone ***https://github.com/4realwth/PasswordManager.git***
Install Required Packages
Navigate to the project directory and run:
***pip install -r requirements.txt***

**Usage:**
To start the password manager, run:
***python main.py***
Follow the on-screen prompts to generate, store, retrieve, or delete passwords.

**How It Works:**
Password Generation: Utilizes a combination of letters, numbers, and special characters to create strong passwords.
Encryption: Uses the cryptography library for secure encryption and decryption of passwords.
Storage: Passwords are stored in an encrypted format in an SQLite database.
Security
Encryption is performed using Fernet symmetric encryption from the cryptography library.
The encryption key is generated upon each run for demonstration purposes. In a production environment, a more secure key management approach should be used.
